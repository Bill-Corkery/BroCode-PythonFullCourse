name = "Bro"
print(type(name))
print("Hello " + name)
first_name="Bro"
last_name="Code"
full_name=first_name + last_name
print("Hello "+ full_name)

#when assign value of int type not with quotes
# because cant use strings with math
age = 21
age +=1
#Better way to write above is age +=1
print(age)
print(type(age))
print('Your age is: '+str(age))

#Float
height=250.5
print(height)
print(type(height))

#Boolean. Can only store True or False
human = False
print(human)
print(type(human))
