#Lesson 37: Modules
# a file containing python code. may contain functions, classes, etc.
# Used with modular programming, which is to separate a program into parts.

# so this is a module (37-Modules). So lets say there is another module called messages and has two functions.
# the first is hello() and the second is bye().
#import messages as msg  # this imports the messages module as msg (makes it easier).
#msg.hello()       # this would call the hello() function from the messages module.

# another way to import is below.
# it is longer at first but no longer need message or msg before function.
#from messages import hello,bye  # cann also say import * which imports all. dont do this as huge.
#hello()
#bye()

# prepackaged modules below.
# can also go to python module index on python.org.
